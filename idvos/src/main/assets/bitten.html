    <li>These Standard Business Terms are exclusively applicable. Any contradictory or diverging standard business terms only become a component of the contract in the event their contents conform to these Standard Business Terms or they have been expressly acknowledged by <strong>identity<sup>.TM</sup></strong> in writing. The foregoing applies likewise in the event <strong>identity<sup>.TM</sup></strong> provides services without reservation with knowledge of contradictory or divergent terms of the users.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>2. THE OBJECT OF THE IDENTIFICATION SERVICE COMPRISES</strong></p>

<ul>
    <li>The establishment examination and verification of identity, possession of a driving license or the verification of the age of a user for the business partner on behalf of a business partner and/or user;</li>
    <li>The transmission of data and information collected to the business partner; and</li>
    <li>The storage of a user profile for purposes of a future age/identity verification or driving license check with the express consent of the user.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3. EXPIRY OF IDENTITY VERIFICATION</strong></p>

<ul>
    <li>Verification and examination of a user&#39;s identity is performed upon request of an <strong>identity<sup>.TM</sup></strong> business partner who either wishes to establish identity or possession of a valid driving license or is required to verify it based on applicable law (e.g. Anti-Money Laundering Act (GwG)) before a contract may be concluded with the business partner.</li>
    <li>Verification of identity is part of an overall process based on a video conference between the user and an <strong>identity<sup>.TM</sup></strong> employee. If needed, the video conference is recorded to preserve evidence.</li>
    <li>In the course of the identity verification process, only data appropriate and necessary in order to verify identity, possession of a driving license or the age of a user is collected based on the relevant legal basis (e.g. Anti-Money Laundering Act (GwG), the Interstate Treaty on the Protection of Minors in the Media (JMStV) or the De-Mail Act). Data collected is then compared to the personal data related to the user provided by the business partner.</li>
    <li>The type and scope of data collection and processing depends on the business partner&#39;s requirements within the context of applicable laws and regulations with respect to identity verification, driving license checks or age verification. Requested data generally includes, name, place of birth, date of birth, citizenship and a user&#39;s address. In the case of a driving license check, this also includes issue date, issuing authority, expiry date, driving license class, valid from, driving license class valid to, driving license class restrictions.</li>
    <li>Depending on applicable laws and regulations, it may be necessary to examine the data referred to above on the basis of a valid, official identification document (e.g. personal identity card). In such cases, additional data included on the identification document may be requested. When performing verification, it may be necessary to photograph both sides of the identification document as well as the user by making a screen shot. This applies likewise in the case of a driving license check.</li>
    <li>Upon agreement, the user will receive a centrally-generated transaction number (TAN) by email or text message during the video conference that may be used for one-time, unique assignment that must be entered immediately by the user during the video conference. Identity verification may only be concluded following successful entry of the TAN.</li>
    <li><strong>identity<sup>.TM&nbsp;</sup></strong>will only confirm the user&#39;s identity to the business partner once the data required for purposes of identity verification, driving license check or age verification are complete and satisfy applicable legal requirements.</li>
    <li><strong>identity<sup>.TM&nbsp;</sup></strong>notifies the business partner of the successful conclusion of user identification or of the driving license check and transmits all screen shots and other data provided by the user, and recordings, created as part of the identification process to the business partner upon request.</li>
